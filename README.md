# PDF.js Express Utilities

This is a package that contains utility functions for working the the PDF.js Express REST API.

This package requires that you have signed up for [PDF.js Express](https://pdfjs.express) and have enabled the API.

This package is intended to be used alongside the [PDF.js Express SDK](https://pdfjs.express/documentation)

The API can currently perform the following actions:

- Merge annotations into a PDF (XFDF into PDF)
- Set annotations on a PDF (XFDF into PDF)
- Extract annotations from a PDF (XFDF from PDF)

It can be used on either the server or the client.

For documentation, APIs, and examples, please see the [API docs](https://pdfjs.express/api/utils)
